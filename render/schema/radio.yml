description:
  Describe a physical radio on the AP. A radio is be parent to several VAPs.
  They all share the same physical properties.
type: object
properties:
  band:
    description:
      Specifies the wireless band to configure the radio for. Available radio device
      phys on the target system are matched by the wireless band given here.
      If multiple radio phys support the same band, the settings specified here will
      be applied to all of them.
    type: string
    enum:

  channel-mode:
    description:
      Define the ideal channel mode that the radio shall use. This can be 802.11n, 802.11ac
      or 802.11ax. This is just a hint for the AP. If the requested value is not supported
      then the AP will use the highest common denominator.
